5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the React Hooks Playground and see the power of each of the following code.

## Available Hooks üé£

### 1. useState

- Description: Adds state to functional components.
- Example Code:
  ```jsx
  import React, { useState } from 'react';

  const Counter = () => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
      setCount(count + 1);
    };

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {count}</p>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  };

  // Usage
  ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('root'));
  ```

### 2. useEffect

- Description: Performs side effects in functional components.
- Example Code:
  ```jsx
  // ... (Example code similar to the previous one)
  ```

### 3. useContext

- Description: Accesses data stored in React's Context API.
- Example Code:
  ```jsx
  // ... (Example code similar to the previous one)
  ```

### 4. useReducer

- Description: Manages complex state logic in functional components.
- Example Code:
  ```jsx
  // ... (Example code similar to the previous one)
  ```

  ```

### 6. useMemo

- Description: Memoizes expensive computations to improve performance.
- Example Code:
  ```jsx
